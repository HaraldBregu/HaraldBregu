# Hi there, I'm Harald Bregu 👋

I'm a software developer passionate about building meaningful digital products from idea to launch. I enjoy taking concepts from early sketches and transforming them into real, working solutions that people can use and benefit from.

## 🚀 What I Love Doing

I love creating awesome products from start to finish. From shaping the initial idea, designing the architecture, solving complex problems, and refining the user experience, I enjoy every phase of the product journey.

I'm especially motivated by inventing new solutions for old problems, challenging assumptions, and finding smarter, more elegant ways to build things.

## 💡 How I Work

I focus on building robust, scalable products with a strong emphasis on clarity, usability, and long-term maintainability. I enjoy working across the entire product lifecycle, connecting technical decisions with real-world impact.
