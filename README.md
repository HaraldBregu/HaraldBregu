# Hi there, I'm Harald Bregu 👋

I'm a software developer with a strong interest in web, mobile, and fullstack applications. I love building robust, scalable solutions across multiple platforms.

## 🚀 Technologies & Frameworks

### Frontend Web Development
I build modern, responsive web applications using **React** and **Angular**, leveraging the power of **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** to create maintainable and scalable codebases.

### Mobile Development
I develop cross-platform mobile applications with **Flutter** and **Dart**, as well as native solutions for **iOS** using **Swift** and **Android** using **Kotlin**. I'm passionate about delivering smooth, performant mobile experiences.

### Desktop Applications
I create cross-platform desktop applications using **Electron**, bringing web technologies to the desktop environment.

### Modern Development Tools
I work with **Effect** for functional programming and building type-safe, composable applications.

## 💡 What I Do

I specialize in fullstack development, working across the entire application stack from frontend user interfaces to mobile apps and desktop solutions. I'm always exploring new technologies and best practices to deliver high-quality software.
